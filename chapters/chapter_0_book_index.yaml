# BOOK OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================

book_overview:
  
  what_this_book_covers: |
    This book presents HSED (Hash|Sign|Encrypt|Decrypt), a permission model 
    for cryptographic operations inspired by Unix file permissions. Just as 
    chmod taught us rwx (read, write, execute), HSED provides a simple, 
    memorable framework for modeling least-privilege access to key management 
    systems (KMS) and hardware security modules (HSMs).
    
    The book progresses from fundamental concepts to production implementation:
    
    - **Fundamentals**: Understanding the HSED permission model and its Unix 
      ancestry
    - **Core Concepts**: Deep dive into each permission bit (H, S, E, D) and 
      their security implications
    - **Implementation**: Practical patterns for CI/CD, secrets management, 
      and audit systems
    - **Integration**: Translating HSED to AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, Azure 
      Key Vault, and GCP Cloud KMS
    - **Security**: Threat modeling, compliance mapping, and incident response
    - **Advanced Topics**: Dynamic permissions, HSM integration, and 
      high-availability patterns
    - **Real-World**: Case studies from financial services, healthcare, SaaS, 
      and government sectors
    
    By the end, you'll understand how to design, implement, and audit 
    cryptographic access controls that are simultaneously secure, simple, 
    and maintainable.
  
  why_this_book_exists: |
    Modern cloud KMS services offer powerful cryptographic capabilities, but 
    their IAM models are complex and inconsistent. Organizations struggle with:
    
    1. **Over-permissive policies**: It's easier to grant kms:* than model 
       fine-grained access
    2. **No standard abstraction**: Each cloud provider uses different 
       terminology and models
    3. **Poor auditability**: Hard to answer "who can decrypt production 
       secrets?"
    4. **Weak separation of duties**: Single roles often combine incompatible 
       permissions
    
    HSED solves these problems with a simple, universal abstraction. If your 
    team understands chmod 755, they'll understand hsed 12.
    
    This book doesn't just present theory - it provides production-ready 
    implementations, policy templates, and real-world examples from systems 
    managing millions of cryptographic operations daily.
  
  how_to_use_this_book: |
    **Sequential readers** (recommended for first-time readers):
    Start with Chapter 1 and progress through each chapter in order. Each 
    chapter builds on concepts introduced previously.
    
    **Selective readers** (experienced practitioners):
    - Need to implement HSED quickly? → Chapter 3 (Implementation Patterns)
    - Integrating with AWS KMS? → Chapter 4, Section 1
    - Preparing for compliance audit? → Chapter 5
    - Debugging production issues? → Chapter 6 (Advanced Topics)
    
    **Reference users**:
    Use the chapter and section indexes to find specific topics. Each section 
    is self-contained with its own examples and takeaways.
    
    **Hands-on learners**:
    Follow along with the examples/ directory in the repository. Each chapter 
    references working code you can run locally.
  
  book_philosophy: |
    This book follows three principles:
    
    1. **Concrete over abstract**: Real examples with actual tool names, 
       specific numbers, and production scenarios. No "Company X" or 
       "Tool Y" placeholders.
    
    2. **Honest about trade-offs**: Every design decision has costs. We 
       discuss what doesn't work and why, including failures and lessons 
       learned.
    
    3. **Immediately actionable**: Every section ends with specific actions 
       you can take today. Theory serves practice, not the other way around.
