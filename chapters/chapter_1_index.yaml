  chapter_overview:
    
    purpose: |
      Chapter 1 establishes the foundational concepts of HSED (Hash|Sign|Encrypt|Decrypt), 
      a permission model for cryptographic operations inspired by Unix file permissions.
      
      This chapter answers three critical questions:
      1. **Why do we need this?** - The problem with existing KMS/HSM IAM models
      2. **What is HSED?** - The four permission bits and how they combine
      3. **How do I use it?** - Standard roles and basic application patterns
      
      By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the HSED model well enough to:
      - Explain it to colleagues using the chmod analogy
      - Identify appropriate roles for common scenarios (CI/CD, secrets, audit)
      - Recognize over-permissive policies in existing systems
      - Apply basic HSED principles to your architecture
      
      This chapter is deliberately practical. Every concept is illustrated with real 
      examples from production systems. Theory serves practice, not the other way around.
    
    structure: |
      The chapter progresses from problem to solution:
      
      - **Sections 1-2**: Establish the problem (why existing IAM is inadequate) and 
        introduce the chmod analogy
      - **Sections 3-5**: Define the HSED model (permission bits, octal notation, roles)
      - **Sections 6-8**: Explain enforcement, composition, and security principles
      - **Sections 9-10**: Apply HSED to real scenarios and common mistakes
      
      Each section is self-contained with overview, examples, and takeaways. You can 
      read sequentially or jump to specific topics.
